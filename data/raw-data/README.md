This folder contains the data 'superstore' which covers the sales data of a retailer for a period of one year.

It contains the variables `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Gender`, `Description`, `InvoiceDate`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country` and `Sales`. The first 5 variables are coded as categorical variables and last 5 are coded as numerical variables which need to be cleaned. The data is cleaned using the 'processing_superstore-v1.qmd' at R\processing-code\ and stored as processed_superstore in the processed-data folder.
